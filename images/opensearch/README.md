# Platform OpenSearch image

Stock OpenSearch plus the IK Chinese analyzer, installed by
`deploy.sh opensearch install`.

## Why this exists

vega-backend probes a fixed candidate list of full-text analyzers at startup
(`standard`, `english`, `ik_max_word`, `hanlp_index`) and caches a successful
snapshot. Startup performs one probe with a 10-second timeout. If OpenSearch is
not ready in time, the failure is cached for 30 seconds; a later capability
request probes once after that cache expires instead of retaining the startup
failure for the process lifetime. The result is served by
`GET /api/vega-backend/v1/index-capabilities` and drives
Studio's analyzer picker. The stock `opensearchproject/opensearch` image carries
no Chinese analyzer, so only `standard` and `english` ever show up — Chinese
text is tokenized per character, and picking `ik_max_word` fails validation
with `analyzer "ik_max_word" ... is unavailable` (HTTP 400).

This image bakes `analysis-ik` in, so `ik_max_word` is available on a fresh
install with no frontend change and no per-environment setup.

The OpenSearch chart's own `plugins.installList` is deliberately **not** used:
it wraps the plugin install into the main container command, so every pod start
re-downloads the plugin from the internet, and any failure there keeps
OpenSearch from starting at all. Offline installs cannot use it.

## Provenance

- Base: `opensearchproject/opensearch:2.19.4`.
- Plugin: `opensearch-analysis-ik-2.19.4.zip` from
  `https://release.infinilabs.com/analysis-ik/stable/`, pinned by SHA-256 in
  the Dockerfile.

The plugin descriptor pins `opensearch.version=2.19.4`. OpenSearch refuses to
load a plugin whose version does not match the node exactly, so the base image
tag and `IK_VERSION` must be bumped together.

`hanlp_index` stays in vega-backend's candidate list but is not shipped.
OpenSearch has no equivalent of IK's maintained release line for HanLP: every
implementation is a personal port of KennFalcon's Elasticsearch plugin, and
the most active one (`Canva/opensearch-hanlp-plugin`) publishes releases only
for 2.10.0 / 2.19.1 / 2.19.2 — none of which loads on a 2.19.4 node, since the
descriptor version must match exactly. Shipping it would mean building from
source against every OpenSearch bump plus distributing the HanLP dictionaries.
The probe simply drops it, same as today.

## Startup and readiness strategy

The bundled installer waits for the OpenSearch Helm release before installing
Foundry services. This ordering reduces startup races but is not a correctness
guarantee: either workload can be restarted or upgraded independently, and an
external OpenSearch cluster is outside the installer lifecycle.

vega-backend readiness therefore remains scoped to the Vega process. Making it
depend on OpenSearch would remove unrelated Vega APIs from service during a
search outage. Analyzer capability probing instead uses a bounded timeout and a
request-triggered recovery path. A failed snapshot returns unavailable until
its cache expires; the next capability-dependent request then performs one
refresh while concurrent requests wait for the same result. A successful
snapshot remains stable until vega-backend is restarted.

## Build & publish

CI (`.github/workflows/release-deploy-opensearch.yml`) builds
`linux/amd64,linux/arm64` on any push touching this directory and publishes to
GHCR plus the Huawei SWR mirror as
`opensearch:2.19.4-<branch>.<committime>.sha<short>` (base `2.19.4` = the
OpenSearch version, not the repo VERSION).

This image is the installer default. `deploy/scripts/lib/common.sh` pins
`OPENSEARCH_IMAGE_REPOSITORY=opensearch` and
`OPENSEARCH_IMAGE_TAG=2.19.4-main.20260818163046.shaaeb5d56`; the offline
image list in `deploy/scripts/sync-k8s-images.sh` carries the same tag. Publishing
a rebuild means bumping both, so a cluster always names the exact build it runs.

Pinning a different image for one environment:

```bash
OPENSEARCH_IMAGE_REPOSITORY=opensearch \
OPENSEARCH_IMAGE_TAG=<tag> \
  ./deploy.sh opensearch install
```

Local one-off:

```bash
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
  -t <registry>/openbkn-ai/opensearch:<tag> --push deploy/images/opensearch
```

## Verifying

After the pod is up:

```bash
curl -s -XPOST "http://<opensearch>:9200/_analyze" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"analyzer":"ik_max_word","text":"知识网络"}'
```

Word-level tokens (not single characters) means the plugin loaded.

## Upgrading an existing environment

1. Point OpenSearch at this image and roll the StatefulSet.
2. **Restart vega-backend.** Successful analyzer capability snapshots remain
   stable for the process lifetime, so installing a new plugin still requires a
   restart. Automatic refresh is limited to recovering from a probe that has
   never succeeded.
3. Rebuild indexes that should use it. The analyzer is fixed at index creation
   time, so existing indexes keep their old tokenization until the object type
   is re-pushed and the build task re-run.
